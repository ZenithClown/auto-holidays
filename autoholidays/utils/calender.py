Utility Calender Function for Auto-Holidays Module

The calender is a special utility function and not to be confused with
the :mod:`calender` which have a different functionality. The defined
objects may/maynot be directly related to the python in-built
module which deals with calender days and calculations around it.

    get the name defined in the enum and :attr:`.value` to get the

    Once the enum is extended to other pydantic base models, we can
    directly use the value without field validation as the value is
    already validated by the enum.
