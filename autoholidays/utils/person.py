A Utility Base Model to define a Person

A person is an end user who is going to consume the API to find the
best possible leave. The module provides the ability to find the best
possible combination for a single or a group of person, thus defining
a structured people's construct is essential.

    Defination of a Enduser or a Person

    The person constuct is defined considering defualt attributes and
    properties which might be required to find the optimal holidays.

    The person construct should be defined as per the planning cycle,
    thus the year-month and days should be constant. This is because,
    for each cycle the holidays and type of leaves can differ, but
    we can create an extended class to track historic leaves - which
    is out of scope of this package and should be handled seperately.

        leave planning cycle for a person.
