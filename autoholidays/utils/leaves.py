An Utility ENUM & Pydantic Base Model for Leaves

The module defines a standard way to define a leave for an user. The
different functionality includes:

    * :class:`CompWeeklyLeave` - a process to define compulsary weekly
        leaves for an user. The defination allows to fetch the days
        which are holidays and in sync with other leaves can calculate
        long weekends.

The module uses the :mod:`pydantic` and :mod:`enum` for a structured
defination of leaves which can be extended to the API module.

    Compulsory Weekly-Off Leave Schema/Construct Definition

    The weekly leave schema defines the days of the week when a user
    has a holiday. The days are typically Sunday and Saturday, and
    is same as the weekly off days for an organization.

    :type  days: set[ENUMDays]
    :param days: A set of :class:`ENUMDays` enum values representing
        the days of the week when a user has a holiday. The days are
        typically Sunday and Saturday, default value.

    :type  D#: tuple[bool]
    :param D#: A tuple of boolean values representing each week of a
        month if the weekly-off is available. For example, an user may
        have every alternate Saturday as a weekly-off, so we can
        set a tuple like :attr:`(True, False, True, False, True)`
        denoting 1st-, 3rd- and 5th-week of the month as weekly-off.
        Defaults to all true, that is everyday is considered.

    Example Usage
    -------------

    The weeklc construct is significantly useful to find if a particular
    day is a weekly-off day or not. For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        import datetime as dt
        import autoholidays as ah

        # let's define a day to simulate the leave
        cur_date = dt.date(2025, 5, 4)

        # let's define the weekly leave construct with defaults
        weekly = ah.utils.CompWeeklyLeave()
        dayset = set([day.value for day in weekly.days])

        # check for each day if it is a weekly-off day or not
        print(f"Weekly Off: {cur_date.weekday() in dayset}")
        >> Weekly Off: True

    To set an custom value for a user's compulsory weekly off, use
    the set dictionary expansion like:

    .. code-block:: python

        # setting values by using the enum name property
        weekly = ah.utils.CompWeeklyLeave(days={
            ah.utils.ENUMDays.SUNDAY
        })

        # setting values by using the enum value property
        weekly = ah.utils.CompWeeklyLeave(days = {
            ah.utils.ENUMDays(6)
        })

    Leave Days Calculation
    ----------------------

    The leave days considers the days of a week and calculates the
    required number of leaves to be availaed. The weekly construct now
    can be used to calculate the number of leaves excluding the weekly
    off days.

    .. code-block:: text

        S M T W T F S
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6
        0 1 1 1 1 1 0 # number of leaves required

    Considering the default weekly-off days, the number of leaves to
    be availed is 5 (Monday to Friday), excluding the weekly-off days.

    D# Naming Convention
    -------------------

    The D# naming convention is used to number the days for the ENUM
    :class:`ENUMDays` representing a valid day. The convention is used
    as :mod:`pydantic` does not allow (?) use of integer naming.

    The calander or related class should be able to handle the value
    :attr:`D#` by converting the name like:

    .. code-block:: python

        int("D#".replace("D", ""))

    Alternatively, the class can directly call the value of :attr:`D#`
    for a particular mapping ENUM class (todo).
